# FPID Lookup Fix - Example Usage

## 🔧 Problem Fixed

**Error:** `Invalid object name 'employee'` when trying to lookup FPID

**Solution:** 
- ✅ Updated to use correct `employees` table with `attid` column
- ✅ Added fallback to multiple table structures
- ✅ Added option to skip FPID lookup if having database issues
- ✅ Graceful error handling with detailed feedback

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### 1. Normal Usage (with FPID lookup)
```bash
Manual PIN Attendance → Enter PIN: 7428 → Skip FPID lookup? N

📝 Processing as ZK device attendance...
   Status determined: I (Masuk)
   FPID found: 123456789
   FPLog save: ✅ Record saved successfully
   AttRecord: ✅ Procedure executed successfully
   Queue: ✅ Added to attendance queue
```

### 2. Skip FPID Lookup (if having database issues)
```bash
Manual PIN Attendance → Enter PIN: 7428 → Skip FPID lookup? Y

📝 Processing as ZK device attendance...
   Status determined: I (Masuk)
   FPID lookup skipped (using NULL)
   FPLog save: ✅ Record saved successfully (with NULL fpid)
   AttRecord: ✅ Procedure executed successfully
   Queue: ✅ Added to attendance queue
```

### 3. Alternative Table Detection
```bash
Manual PIN Attendance → Enter PIN: 7428 → Skip FPID lookup? N

📝 Processing as ZK device attendance...
   Status determined: I (Masuk)
   Warning: Could not query employees table: Invalid object name 'employees'
   Found FPID using employee table with fpid
   FPID found: 987654321
   FPLog save: ✅ Record saved successfully
   AttRecord: ✅ Procedure executed successfully
   Queue: ✅ Added to attendance queue
```

## 🔍 FPID Lookup Strategy

The improved `_get_fpid_by_pin()` function tries multiple approaches:

### 1. Primary Method (Standard)
```sql
SELECT attid FROM employees WHERE pin = ?
```

### 2. Fallback Methods (if primary fails)
```sql
-- Alternative table structures
SELECT fpid FROM employee WHERE pin = ?
SELECT id FROM pegawai WHERE pin = ?
SELECT userid FROM userinfo WHERE badgenumber = ?
SELECT emp_id FROM emp_master WHERE emp_code = ?
```

### 3. Skip Option
- User can choose to skip FPID lookup entirely
- System continues with NULL fpid value
- All other processes work normally

## 📊 Sample Output

### Successful FPID Lookup
```
🖐️  MANUAL PIN ATTENDANCE
Device: 104 (zk)
============================================================
Enter PIN/User ID: 7428

Punch codes:
0 = Check In (Masuk)
1 = Check Out (Keluar)
2 = Break Out
3 = Break In
4 = Overtime In
5 = Overtime Out
Enter punch code (0-5, default=0): 0

Skip FPID lookup? (y/N): n

🚀 Processing attendance...
   PIN: 7428
   Punch Code: 0
   Device: 104
   Time: 2025-10-03 14:30:15
   FPID Lookup: Enabled

   FPLog save: ✅ Record saved successfully
   AttRecord: ✅ Procedure executed successfully for PIN 7428

### FPID Not Found (but continues processing)
```
📝 Processing as ZK device attendance...
   Status determined: I (Masuk)
   No FPID found for PIN 7428 in any available table
   FPLog save: ✅ Record saved successfully (with NULL fpid)
   AttRecord: ✅ Procedure executed successfully for PIN 7428
   Queue: ✅ Added to attendance queue

✅ ATTENDANCE PROCESSED SUCCESSFULLY!
```

### Skipped FPID Lookup
```
📝 Processing as ZK device attendance...
   Status determined: I (Masuk)
   FPID lookup skipped (using NULL)
   FPLog save: ✅ Record saved successfully (with NULL fpid)
   AttRecord: ✅ Procedure executed successfully for PIN 7428
   Queue: ✅ Added to attendance queue

✅ ATTENDANCE PROCESSED SUCCESSFULLY!
```

## 🛠️ Error Handling

### Database Connection Issues
```
   Warning: Could not get FPID for PIN 7428: Connection timeout
   FPLog save: ✅ Record saved successfully (with NULL fpid)
```

### Table Structure Issues
```
   Warning: Could not query employees table: Invalid object name 'employees'
   Found FPID using employee table with fpid
   FPID found: 987654321
```

### Complete Failure (graceful degradation)
```
   Warning: Could not query employees table: Invalid object name 'employees'
   No FPID found for PIN 7428 in any available table
   FPLog save: ✅ Record saved successfully (with NULL fpid)
```

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **🔄 Robust FPID Lookup**: Tries multiple table structures
2. **⚡ Graceful Degradation**: Works even if FPID lookup fails
3. **🚫 Skip Option**: User can bypass FPID lookup if needed
4. **📋 Detailed Feedback**: Clear messages about what's happening
5. **✅ Continues Processing**: Attendance processing doesn't stop for FPID issues
6. **🔍 Multiple Fallbacks**: Supports various database schemas

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **FPID is optional**: Attendance processing works with or without FPID
- **NULL values accepted**: Database can handle NULL fpid values
- **Performance**: FPID lookup adds minimal overhead
- **Compatibility**: Works with various database table structures
- **User Control**: User can choose to skip lookup if experiencing issues

The system is now **much more robust** and will work even if your database doesn't have the standard employee/employees table structure! 🎉
